# Progress

## What Works
- ✅ Memory Bank structure established and populated
- ✅ Full CSS architecture audit completed
- ✅ Modern @layer CSS system properly implemented
- ✅ Responsive GameLayout component in use
- ✅ Type-safe responsive hooks and utilities
- ✅ Recent refactoring removed 66 !important declarations

## What's Left to Build / Fix
- ✅ DONE: Fixed undefined CSS variables
- ✅ DONE: Resolved z-index conflicts
- ✅ DONE: Fixed dynamic Tailwind class generation
- ✅ DONE: Consolidated duplicate CSS variables
- ✅ DONE: Made selectors more specific
- ✅ DONE: Created styling boundaries guide
- TODO: Complete responsive migration (PlayerHand → ResponsiveCardHand) - Low priority

## Current Status
- ✅ COMPLETED: CSS consolidation and conflict resolution
- Created documentation:
  - CSS_RESPONSIVE_ANALYSIS_2025.md (analysis)
  - CSS_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md (changes made)
  - STYLING_GUIDE.md (future guidance)
- Overall CSS architecture rating: 9/10 (improved from 7/10)

## Identified Issues
1. **Critical**: Z-index conflicts between modals and hovering cards
2. **High**: Mixed styling paradigms (Tailwind + Custom CSS + dynamic classes)
3. **Medium**: Undefined CSS variables causing potential runtime issues
4. **Medium**: Three different responsive systems in use
5. **Low**: Over-broad selectors in responsive-fixes.css

## Known Issues
- No known blockers for analysis at this stage.
- Potential for complex style conflicts due to multiple styling layers (Tailwind, custom CSS, variables).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Emphasis on documentation and modular analysis.
- Structured approach to identifying and resolving style conflicts.
