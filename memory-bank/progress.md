# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank structure established and populated.
- Project context, system patterns, and tech stack documented.
- Initial plan for comprehensive styling and responsiveness analysis in place.

## What's Left to Build / Analyze
- Full audit of all CSS, Tailwind, and custom style files for conflicts.
- Review of responsive design implementation in all major components and layouts.
- Cross-reference documentation and audit files (CSS variable usage, responsive guides, etc.).
- Summarize and document findings, issues, and recommendations.

## Current Status
- Analysis phase: preparing to audit styles and responsiveness.

## Known Issues
- No known blockers for analysis at this stage.
- Potential for complex style conflicts due to multiple styling layers (Tailwind, custom CSS, variables).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Emphasis on documentation and modular analysis.
- Structured approach to identifying and resolving style conflicts.

## This Document
Update as analysis progresses and findings are made.
