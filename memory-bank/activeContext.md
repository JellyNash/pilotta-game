# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Comprehensive and complete analysis of the project to identify styling conflicts.
- Thorough review of the responsiveness of the game as a whole.
- Documentation of findings and recommendations.

## Recent Changes
- Memory Bank initialized and core files created.
- Project context, system patterns, and tech stack documented.

## Next Steps
1. Audit all CSS, Tailwind, and custom style files for conflicts and overrides.
2. Review responsive design implementation across components and layouts.
3. Analyze documentation and audit files (e.g., CSS variable usage, responsive guides).
4. Summarize findings, highlight issues, and propose solutions.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritize identifying style conflicts that impact user experience or maintainability.
- Focus on real-world responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Leverage existing documentation and audit outputs.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind, but custom CSS for overrides.
- Responsive hooks and layout systems in use.
- CSS variables for theme and runtime adjustments.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project is well-structured for modular analysis.
- Multiple layers of styling (Tailwind, custom CSS, variables) require careful conflict resolution.
