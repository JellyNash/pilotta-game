# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- âœ… COMPLETED: CSS consolidation and conflict resolution
- Created documents: CSS_RESPONSIVE_ANALYSIS_2025.md, CSS_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md, STYLING_GUIDE.md

## Recent Changes
- Fixed 4 undefined CSS variables in tokens.css
- Resolved z-index conflicts with proper layering (13 levels)
- Fixed dynamic Tailwind class generation with suitColors.ts utility
- Consolidated duplicate CSS variable definitions
- Made responsive-fixes.css selectors more specific
- Created comprehensive styling guide

## Key Findings
1. **CSS Architecture**: Modern @layer system well-implemented
2. **Major Conflicts**: Z-index overlaps, duplicate selectors, mixed styling paradigms
3. **Responsive Issues**: Three different responsive systems causing inconsistencies
4. **Recent Improvements**: Successfully removed 66 !important declarations

## Next Steps
1. Implement immediate fixes for undefined CSS variables
2. Resolve z-index conflicts in tokens.css
3. Complete responsive system migration
4. Establish clear boundaries between Tailwind and custom CSS

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritize identifying style conflicts that impact user experience or maintainability.
- Focus on real-world responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Leverage existing documentation and audit outputs.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind, but custom CSS for overrides.
- Responsive hooks and layout systems in use.
- CSS variables for theme and runtime adjustments.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project is well-structured for modular analysis.
- Multiple layers of styling (Tailwind, custom CSS, variables) require careful conflict resolution.
