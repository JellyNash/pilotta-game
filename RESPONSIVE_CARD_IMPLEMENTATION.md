# Responsive Card Display Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Card Component Updates (`Card.tsx`)

#### Fixed Legend Proportions
- **Main legend size reduced**: From 0.45/0.48 to 0.25/0.28 of card height
- **Corner legend size reduced**: From 0.20 to 0.12 of card height
- **Added padding**: Center display now has `p-4` to ensure no overlap with corners
- **Adjusted positioning**: Corner indicators moved to `top-2 left-2` and `bottom-2 right-2` for better spacing

#### Responsive Sizing
- Added new `responsive` size option
- Support for custom `width` and `height` props
- Dynamic font size calculation based on actual card dimensions
- Improved shadow and text effects for better visibility

### 2. PlayerHand Component Updates (`PlayerHand.tsx`)

#### Arc Display Implementation
- **Dynamic arc calculation**: Cards form an upward arc when space is limited
- **No overlap**: Cards are sized to fit available space without overlapping
- **Arc parameters**:
  - Maximum arc angle: 60 degrees
  - Arc radius calculated based on available width
  - Cards evenly distributed along the arc

#### Responsive Card Layout
- **Automatic sizing**: Cards resize based on viewport and number of cards
- **Size constraints**:
  - Horizontal: 60-120px width (before accessibility scaling)
  - Vertical: 60-100px width
- **Space utilization**:
  - Horizontal: Uses 80% of viewport width (max 1200px)
  - Vertical: Uses 40% of viewport height (max 500px)

#### Position Calculations
- Each card has individual x, y, and rotation values
- Human player (south) gets special arc treatment for better visibility
- AI players use linear layout with subtle fan effect
- All corner legends remain visible due to arc arrangement

### 3. Key Features

#### True Responsiveness
- Cards dynamically resize to fit available space
- No overlap between cards - they shrink instead
- Minimum and maximum size constraints ensure readability
- Accessibility scaling still applies on top of base sizing

#### Legend Visibility
- Proportions adjusted to prevent overlap
- Padding ensures main legend never touches corners
- Font sizes scale with card dimensions
- Text shadows improve contrast

#### Arc Display
- Upward arc reveals all corner legends
- Arc angle and radius adapt to card count
- Smooth animations with framer-motion
- Hover effects maintain proper z-indexing

## Usage Notes

1. The `size="responsive"` option enables fully dynamic sizing
2. Cards will automatically form an arc when needed (human player only)
3. All accessibility features are preserved
4. Drag and drop functionality remains intact
5. Keyboard navigation works with the new layout

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different numbers of cards (1-8)
2. Test on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Test with accessibility scaling at different levels
4. Verify corner legends are always visible
5. Check that cards never overlap regardless of viewport size
