# Card Stacking Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The cards were stacking on top of each other because both inline styles and CSS were trying to position the cards, creating a conflict. The PlayerHand component was setting `transform` styles directly on each card element, while the CSS file also had transform rules using `:nth-child` selectors.

## Root Cause
- **Inline styles** (set in PlayerHand.tsx) have higher CSS specificity than stylesheet rules
- Both inline styles and CSS were applying transforms, causing positioning conflicts
- The motion.div animation was also trying to animate the `y` position, adding another layer of transform

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Inline Transform Styles
- Removed the inline `transform` calculations from PlayerHand.tsx
- Now only using CSS for positioning cards

### 2. Simplified Component Style Props
- Changed from complex inline style object to only passing `--card-index` CSS variable
- This is used for z-index calculations in CSS

### 3. Fixed Motion Animation Conflicts
- Removed `y` animation from Framer Motion's animate prop
- Let CSS handle all positioning including hover effects

### 4. Updated CSS Hover States
- Created specific hover rules for each card position (nth-child)
- Hover state now lifts cards by subtracting 20px from their Y position
- Maintained the fan arc shape during hover

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/PlayerHand.tsx`
   - Removed inline transform calculations
   - Removed unused hover transform function
   - Simplified cardStyle object
   - Removed y animation from motion.div

2. `/src/components/PlayerHand.css`
   - Added specific hover states for each card position
   - Updated z-index management with !important flags
   - Maintained existing positioning logic

## Result
- Cards now properly fan out in the human player's hand
- Hover effects work correctly with 10% scale and 20px lift
- No more stacking issues
- CSS is the single source of truth for positioning
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Testing
Created a test file `/test-card-positioning.html` to verify CSS positioning works in isolation.

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix in the running application
2. Apply similar approach to other UI elements if they have positioning issues
3. Consider removing other inline style calculations in favor of CSS classes
