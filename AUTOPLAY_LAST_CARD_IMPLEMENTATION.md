# Auto-Play Last Card Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic playing of the last card when the human player has only one card remaining and only one legal move available.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **`/src/game/GameFlowController.ts`** (lines 286-310)
   - Added auto-play logic in the `handlePlaying` method
   - Checks if human player has exactly 1 card and 1 legal move
   - Automatically plays the card after a 300ms delay for better UX
   - Includes sound effect playback
   - Continues game flow after auto-play

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// If human player, check for auto-play of last card
if (!currentPlayer.isAI) {
  // Auto-play if only one card left and it's the only legal move
  if (currentPlayer.hand.length === 1 && legalMoves.length === 1) {
    // Add a small delay for better UX
    await this.delay(300);
    
    // Play the last card automatically
    const lastCard = legalMoves[0];
    this.dispatch(playCard({ 
      playerId: currentPlayer.id, 
      card: lastCard 
    }));
    
    // Play card sound
    soundManager.play('cardPlay');
    
    // Continue game flow
    await this.runGameFlow();
    return;
  }
  
  // Otherwise, wait for input
  return;
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Improved UX**: Eliminates unnecessary clicking when there's only one possible move
2. **Faster Gameplay**: Speeds up the end of each round
3. **Maintains Game Feel**: 300ms delay ensures the auto-play doesn't feel jarring
4. **Audio Feedback**: Card play sound maintains consistency with manual plays

## Testing
1. Start a new game
2. Play through until the last trick
3. When you have only one card left, it should play automatically
4. Verify the card sound plays and game continues normally

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add a setting to disable auto-play if some players prefer manual control
- Show a brief animation or indicator when auto-playing
- Extend to auto-play any time there's only one legal move (not just last card)
