# Session 17 Changelog - Announcement System Fix & Declaration UI Enhancement

## Date: 2025-01-06

### Overview
Fixed critical announcement positioning bugs and enhanced the declaration UI for better visibility and user experience.

### 1. Announcement System Positioning Fix ✅

#### Problem
- All announcements were collapsing to the center of the screen
- Center-based positioning with `position: fixed` was not working correctly
- Multiple announcements would overlap at the same position

#### Solution
- Switched from center-based transforms to viewport-based positioning
- Each player position now has distinct screen coordinates:
  ```css
  North: { left: 50%, top: 15vh }
  South: { left: 50%, top: 75vh } // 65vh when bidding
  East: { left: 80vw, top: 50% }
  West: { left: 20vw, top: 50% }
  ```

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Before (broken):
transform: `translate(-50%, -50%) translateY(-${radius})`

// After (working):
left: '50%',
top: '15vh',
transform: 'translateX(-50%)'
```

### 2. Professional Animation System ✅

#### Enhancements
- Directional enter/exit animations based on player position
- Custom spring physics: `stiffness: 400, damping: 30, mass: 0.8`
- Professional easing curve: `[0.23, 1, 0.32, 1]`
- Glass morphism effects with backdrop blur
- Hardware acceleration optimizations

#### CSS Improvements
```css
.announcement-container {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  perspective: 1000px;
}

.announcement-card {
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(180%);
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### 3. Duplicate Prevention ✅

#### Problem
- Notifications and declarations were being announced multiple times
- Despite tracking in AnnouncementSystem, duplicates came from GameTable

#### Solution
Added tracking sets in GameTable:
```typescript
const [shownNotificationTimestamps, setShownNotificationTimestamps] = useState<Set<number>>(new Set());
const [shownDeclarationIds, setShownDeclarationIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

### 4. Declaration UI Enhancements ✅

#### Simplified Announcements
- Removed "points" text - shows only the number
- Increased font size by 50% for declarations:
  ```typescript
  fontSize: announcement.type === 'declaration' ? 
    'calc(var(--announcement-font-size) * 1.5)' : 
    'var(--announcement-font-size)'
  ```

#### New Declaration Cards Display
Created `DeclarationCardsDisplay.tsx` component:

**Features:**
- Shows actual declaration cards in front of player's hand
- Only appears in trick 2 for players with `hasShown: true`
- Perspective-aware positioning for each player
- Golden glow effect on declaration cards
- Points badge with value display
- Smooth staggered animations

**Positioning:**
```typescript
case 'south':
  bottom: 'calc(var(--card-height) * 1.2)',
  left: '50%',
  transform: 'translateX(-50%)'
```

**Rotation Logic:**
- Cards fan out naturally from player's perspective
- Counter-rotation for points badge to keep text upright
- Proper rotation for north (180°), east (-90°), west (90°)

### 5. Declaration Flow Timing ✅

#### Implementation
- Trick 1: Show points announcement only
- Trick 2: Show actual declaration cards
- Controlled by `trickNumber` in GameTable

```typescript
// Points announcement (trick 1)
if (!declarationTracking || phase !== GamePhase.Playing || trickNumber !== 1) return;

// Cards display (trick 2)
show={
  phase === GamePhase.Playing && 
  trickNumber === 2 && 
  declarationTracking?.[player.id]?.hasShown === true
}
```
