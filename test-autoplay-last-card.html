    <h1>Test Auto-Play Last Card Feature</h1>
    <p>This feature automatically plays the last card when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The human player has only 1 card left in hand</li>
        <li>There is only 1 legal move available (which would be that last card)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Test:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start a new game at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a></li>
        <li>Play through the game normally</li>
        <li>When you reach the last trick and have only one card left, it should automatically play after a 300ms delay</li>
        <li>You should hear the card play sound effect</li>
        <li>The game should continue normally after the auto-play</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Expected Behavior:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Last card plays automatically with a small delay for UX</li>
        <li>✅ Card play sound effect plays</li>
        <li>✅ No user interaction needed</li>
        <li>✅ Game flow continues seamlessly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Implementation Details:</h2>
    <p>The auto-play logic was added to <code>GameFlowController.ts</code> in the <code>handlePlaying</code> method.</p>
    <p>When it's the human player's turn, the system checks if they have only 1 card left and only 1 legal move.</p>
    <p>If both conditions are met, the card is played automatically after a 300ms delay.</p>
