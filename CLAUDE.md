This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current Project Status (Session 27 - January 2025)

**✅ ALL RESPONSIVE FIXES COMPLETED**

The project has successfully completed a comprehensive responsive design overhaul:

1. **Z-Index Hierarchy**: Fixed - table elements no longer clip cards
2. **Card Overlaps**: All bot players now use 50% overlap (55% for 8 cards)
3. **Zoom Feature**: Viewport space reservation prevents clipping
4. **Bidding Interface**: Fully responsive with mobile vertical stacking
5. **Declaration Cards**: Clamp-based positioning implemented
6. **Container Overflow**: Consistent `overflow: visible` everywhere

**Key Achievements**:
- Works perfectly from 320px to 4K displays
- All values use clamp() functions - no hardcoded pixels
- Single source of truth in tokens.css
- Modern CSS architecture with @layer system
- Basic accessibility restored (keyboard nav, ARIA labels)

**Documentation Created**:

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + CSS modules
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Drag & Drop**: react-dnd (HTML5 + Touch backends)

### Core Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Game Engine Layer** (`/src/core/`)
   - `types.ts`: Central type definitions for the entire game
   - `gameRules.ts`: Core game logic and rule validation
   - `cardUtils.ts`: Card manipulation and comparison utilities

2. **State Management** (`/src/store/`)
   - Single Redux store with typed slices
   - `gameSlice.ts`: Manages all game state including players, cards, scores, and game phases
   - Actions handle all state transitions (dealing, bidding, playing cards, scoring)

3. **Game Flow Control** (`/src/game/`)
   - `GameManager.ts`: Singleton that orchestrates the game flow
   - `GameFlowController.ts`: Manages phase transitions and game progression
   - Handles async operations like AI thinking time and animations

4. **AI System** (`/src/ai/`)
   - Multiple AI personalities (Conservative, Aggressive, Balanced, Adaptive)
   - MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) implementation for advanced decision making
   - Strategy evaluation based on game state and player behavior

5. **Component Layer** (`/src/components/`)
   - Modular React components for all UI elements
   - Key components: GameTable, PlayerHand, BiddingInterface, TrickArea
   - Focus on responsive design and performance

6. **Layout System** (`/src/layouts/`)
   - Responsive design system with CSS Grid and custom properties
   - Center-based positioning for consistent layout at all resolutions
   - Responsive variables for scaling across different screen sizes

### Game Flow

The game follows a strict phase progression:
1. **Dealing**: Cards distributed to players counter-clockwise
2. **Bidding**: Players bid for contract (with pass/double/redouble options)
3. **Declaring**: Optional declarations (sequences, four of a kind)
4. **Playing**: Trick-taking gameplay
5. **Scoring**: Points calculation and round transition

### Key Patterns

- **Event-Driven**: User actions dispatch Redux actions that update state
- **AI Integration**: AI players make decisions asynchronously without blocking UI
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch support
- **Performance First**: Memoized components, optimized animations, extracted animation variants

### Important Considerations

- The game implements full Pilotta rules including complex scoring and declarations
- AI personalities affect bidding aggressiveness and playing style
- All card interactions support both drag-and-drop and click-to-play
- Animations use Framer Motion with pre-defined variants to prevent recreations
- Sound effects are managed through `soundManager.ts` with proper cleanup

## Current State of the Project

### UI Features
1. **Card System**:
   - Human player cards in downward arc with hover animations
   - Multiple card styles: classic, modern, accessible, minimalist
   - Right-click zoom feature (200% scale)
   - Responsive sizing based on viewport

2. **Bidding Interface**:
   - Three-row layout with consistent button sizing
   - Touch-friendly targets with proper spacing
   - Responsive scaling with CSS variables
   - Modern glass morphism design with 2025 style

3. **Game Features**:
   - Counter-clockwise game progression (traditional Pilotta)
   - Random initial dealer selection
   - Fixed team trick pile positions
   - Previous trick viewer with visual indicators
   - Automatic Belote/Rebelote announcements

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Component Memoization**: Card, PlayerHand, TrickArea, BiddingInterface, ScoreBoard
2. **Animation Variants**: Extracted to `/src/animations/animationVariants.ts`
3. **Audio Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio elements
4. **React Hooks**: useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations

### Responsive Layout System
- CSS Grid-based layout with defined areas
- Center-based positioning system in `/src/layouts/table-center.css`
- Responsive variables in `/src/layouts/responsive-variables.css`
- Scales from 1280x720 to 2560x1440+

### Technical Debt
- **Web Worker**: AI worker implementation exists but needs Vite configuration fixes
- **Redux Structure**: New modular slices created but not yet integrated

### Important Files
- Animation Variants: `/src/animations/animationVariants.ts`
- Responsive CSS: `/src/layouts/responsive-variables.css`, `/src/layouts/game-grid.css`
- Layout Components: `/src/components/PlayerZone.tsx`, `/src/layouts/PositioningSystem.tsx`
- Performance Testing: `test-visual-regression.cjs`

### Accessibility Status
- Basic keyboard navigation added to Card component
- ARIA labels added to interactive components
- Focus indicators for keyboard users
- Still limited compared to full accessibility standards

### Game Rules Compliance
- ✅ Trump obligation working correctly
- ✅ Belote announcement automatic and compulsory
- ✅ Card rankings correct (Trump: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7)
- ✅ Counter-clockwise progression
- ✅ Team-based scoring and trick piles

## Latest Session Updates (2025-01-06)

### Session 24 - Responsive Refactoring Implementation (Phases 1-2)

   - Created comprehensive token system in `tokens.css`:
     - 9 typography sizes using clamp() (--fs-3xs to --fs-3xl)
     - 10 spacing sizes using clamp() (--space-3xs to --space-4xl)
     - Component dimensions (cards, buttons, modals, inputs)
     - Visual effects (5 blur levels, 5 shadow spreads)
     - Border widths and radii with clamp()
     - Animation tokens (durations and easing functions)
   - Added composite tokens:
     - Shadow definitions (glow, drop, inset variations)
     - Glass morphism effects (sm/md/lg)
   - Removed redundant media queries from tokens.css

2. **Phase 2.1: Card System Migration COMPLETED**:

   - Now: Only 2 piles total, one per team
   - Team B pile: Upper left corner (top-4 left-4)
   - Team A pile: Lower right corner (bottom-4 right-4) - Human player's team
   - Removed trick piles from individual player zones
   - Piles now rendered as overlays in GameTable component

2. **TrickPileViewer Complete Redesign**:
   - **Initial fix**: Resolved card overlap issue using CSS Grid layout
   - **Cross formation**: Human at bottom, partner at top, opponents on sides
